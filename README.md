# Sketch'n'Solve

Sketch'n'Solve is a React-based application that allows users to draw mathematical expressions or notes on a canvas, calculate results from their sketches, and download their notes, including the rendered LaTeX equations. This project integrates **MathJax** for rendering LaTeX, **Gemini Flash 1.5** for backend result generation, and other tools for an interactive user experience.
